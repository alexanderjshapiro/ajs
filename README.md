# AJS

This is my personal website that points to places where people can connect with me and see my work. It's designed to be lightweight and uses strict, new, or experimental web and email security standards such as CAA, CSP, DANE, DMARC, DNSSEC, HSTS, MTA-STS, SRI, and TLS-RPT. All code was optimized down to one file, with any inline styles and scripting secured by CSP hashes.
